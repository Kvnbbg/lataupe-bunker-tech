# ADR-001: Adopt the Senior Developer Modernization Framework

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2025-10-28
- **Context:**
  - The Lataupe Bunker Tech codebase has evolved organically with limited automation, documentation drift, and ad-hoc security controls.
  - Stakeholders require higher confidence in deployments, faster iteration cycles, and stronger governance due to the critical nature of bunker monitoring.
- **Decision:**
  - Adopt the Senior Developer's Modernization Framework as the guiding doctrine for technical decision-making.
  - Establish the `architecture-council` guild as the owner of modernization artifacts and maintainers of this ADR log.
  - Execute the roadmap outlined in the Senior Architect's Modernization Briefing, prioritizing CI/CD automation, DevSecOps practices, and observability foundations.
- **Consequences:**
  - All new initiatives must document alignment with the framework and reference this ADR.
  - CI/CD enforcement and branch protection become mandatory gates for production deployments.
  - Additional work is required to onboard teams to new tooling (GitHub Actions, Vault, telemetry stack) and to maintain modernization artifacts as living documents.
